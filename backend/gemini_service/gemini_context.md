# Project IDX Workspace Transition - fbconsulting

## Summary (March 28, 2025)

After extensive troubleshooting, the previous IDX workspace encountered persistent Vite build errors related to resolving core `react` dependencies (`react`, `react-dom/client`, `react/jsx-runtime`). These errors persisted despite numerous cleanup attempts (`git reset`, `rm -rf node_modules`, `npm cache clean`, `npm install --force --legacy-peer-deps`, workspace rebuilds), suggesting deep environment corruption.

**Current State:**

*   **Backend:** Deployed successfully to Google Cloud Run at `https://gemini-backend-service-74kft2d4ua-lz.a.run.app` and is healthy.
*   **Frontend Code:** Contains numerous fixes (import paths, config updates, syntax errors) applied during troubleshooting. This state is committed and pushed to `origin/main`.
*   **Frontend Build:** Still failing in the old workspace due to the unresolvable React dependencies.

## Setup Steps for NEW IDX Workspace

1.  **Workspace Creation:** Create a new IDX workspace by importing the latest `main` branch from the GitHub repository (`https://github.com/iamfarzad/fbconsulting`). IDX should automatically use the `.idx/dev.nix` file for environment setup.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Open a terminal in the new workspace and run:
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```
    *(Reason: Bypasses the known `react-dom@18` vs `@react-three/fiber` wanting `react-dom@^19` conflict present in the committed `package.json`).*
3.  **Run Dev Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  **Test:**
    *   Verify the Vite dev server starts without the "Cannot resolve react..." errors.
    *   Open the **correct** IDX preview URL (for port 8080/8081, found in the IDX "Backend Ports" panel).
    *   Ensure third-party cookies are allowed for `*.cloudworkstations.dev` / `*.idx.google.com`.
    *   Check the browser console for any runtime errors. Verify WebSocket connection to the Cloud Run backend (`[GeminiProvider] Connecting...`, `[GeminiProvider] WebSocket connected`).

Good luck in the new workspace!
