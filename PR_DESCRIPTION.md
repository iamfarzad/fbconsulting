# Gemini Feature Consolidation

This PR consolidates all Gemini-related code into a cohesive feature module under `src/features/gemini`.

## Changes

### File Structure Changes
- Created new feature directory: `src/features/gemini/`
- Organized code into subdirectories:
  - `config/` - Configuration components
  - `hooks/` - Custom hooks
  - `services/` - Core services
  - `types/` - TypeScript types

### Code Consolidation
- Moved and consolidated duplicated code from:
  - `src/services/gemini`
  - `src/services/chat`
  - `src/services/copilot`
  - `src/hooks/gemini`
  - `src/components/copilot/core`

### Component Updates
- Updated API routes to use new GeminiAdapter
- Refactored UnifiedChatMessageList with consolidated hooks
- Simplified HeroChat implementation
- Improved error handling and loading states

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive README for the Gemini feature
- Included usage examples and best practices
- Updated import paths in existing components
- Added inline documentation for key functions

## Migration Guide
For any components using the old imports:

```typescript
// Old imports
import { useGeminiService } from "src/hooks/gemini/useGeminiService";
import { GoogleGenAIAdapter } from "src/services/copilot/googleGenAIAdapter";

// New imports
import { useGeminiService, GeminiAdapter } from "@/features/gemini";
```

## Testing
- ✅ All Gemini functionality works as expected
- ✅ Chat features are working
- ✅ Audio and multimodal features tested
- ✅ Configuration components verified

## Next Steps
- [ ] Remove deprecated code paths
- [ ] Update remaining components to use new feature
- [ ] Add integration tests for new structure
- [ ] Update documentation in storybook
