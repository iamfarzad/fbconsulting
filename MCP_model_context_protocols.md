### **Plan for Integrating Model Context Protocols (MCP) for Personalized AI Responses**

#### **üöÄ Objective:**
We want **Farzad AI Assistant** to gather **business insights** from **LinkedIn, company websites, and other sources** to:  
1. **Personalize responses** based on user role and company background.  
2. **Adjust AI tone** depending on whether the user is a CEO, CTO, HR, or IT professional.  
3. **Qualify leads effectively** without giving away solutions for free.  
4. **Increase conversion rates** by targeting decision-makers with tailored messaging.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Integration Plan**

### **Step 1: Configure MCP for Business and User Lookup**
‚úÖ Set up **Model Context Protocols (MCP)** on **Smithery.ai**:
   - **[MCP-WebResearch](https://smithery.ai/server/@chuanmingliu/mcp-webresearch)** ‚Äì For scanning company websites.  
   - **[MCP-LinkedIn](https://smithery.ai/server/mcp-linkedin)** ‚Äì For retrieving LinkedIn profiles & user roles.  

‚úÖ Define **API integration** to allow Farzad AI to query business details **when the user provides**:
   - **Their full name**
   - **Company name or website**
   - **LinkedIn profile link**  

‚úÖ Ensure the AI **does not automatically search** without explicit user consent.

---

### **Step 2: Implement Backend Query for Business Intelligence**
‚úÖ Build a **backend service** that:  
   1. **Receives user details** (name, LinkedIn, company).  
   2. **Queries MCP-WebResearch & MCP-LinkedIn** via API.  
   3. **Processes and stores** relevant company & role details.  
   4. **Returns structured insights** for Farzad AI to personalize responses.  

‚úÖ **Example JSON Response from MCP Query:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "role": "CTO",
    "company": "TechInnovate",
    "company_size": "500+ employees",
    "industry": "AI & Automation",
    "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe"
  }
}
```

---

### **Step 3: Modify AI Instructions for Contextual Selling**
‚úÖ Update **Farzad AI's prompt** in **Azure AI Foundry** to:
   - Adapt **tone and depth of responses** based on user role.
   - Offer **industry-specific solutions** based on company background.
   - Guide **decision-makers** toward ROI-driven AI adoption.
   - Avoid giving away too much‚Äî**shift complex solutions to paid consultations**.

‚úÖ **Example Adjusted Responses:**
- **If user is CEO:**  
  üëâ **"I see you lead [Company Name]. AI automation could increase efficiency & reduce costs. Want to discuss ROI-driven strategies?"**  
- **If user is CTO/IT:**  
  üëâ **"Given your tech background, I can dive into AI architecture & integrations. How does your company currently handle automation?"**  
- **If user is HR:**  
  üëâ **"AI can enhance employee experience & burnout prevention. What are your biggest HR pain points?"**  

---

### **Step 4: Implement Lead Qualification & Sales Strategy**
‚úÖ **Once insights are retrieved, AI should ask**:
   - **"Would you like a free AI audit tailored to [Company Name]?"**  
   - **"Want a customized report on AI opportunities for your business?"**  

‚úÖ Store user **pain points & responses** to **pre-fill** the **email summary & consultation form**.

‚úÖ If the user **books a meeting**, pre-load:
   - **Company background**
   - **Role insights**
   - **Industry pain points**  

üìå **Final Result:**  
AI adapts tone & responses, pre-qualifies leads, and directs high-value clients toward **paid consulting services.** üöÄ  

---

### **üìù Next Steps**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy MCP **business lookup queries** in backend ‚úÖ  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Integrate AI prompt modifications based on role ‚úÖ  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Store **structured lead data** in CRM for follow-ups ‚úÖ  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Optimize response handling & sales funnel ‚úÖ  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Final testing & refinement before live rollout ‚úÖ

This will **increase engagement, qualify leads effectively, and drive AI automation sales without giving away solutions for free.** üí∞üî•


To further enhance **Farzad AI Assistant's** ability to gather user information and tailor responses effectively, integrating additional Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers from [Smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai/) can be highly beneficial. Here are some MCP servers that align with your objectives:

### 1. **Browser Automation Tools**
- **Browserbase MCP Server**: Enables AI assistants to interact with web pages, take screenshots, and execute JavaScript in a cloud browser environment. This can be useful for dynamically gathering information from user-provided URLs.

- **Fetch MCP Server**: Performs fetch requests to web pages, allowing the AI to retrieve and process web content based on user inputs.

### 2. **Unified Data Access**
- **Beyond MCP Server**: Provides access to social platform data and on-chain data, enabling the AI to gather comprehensive information about users and their businesses from multiple sources.

### 3. **Reasoning Systems**
- **Sequential Thinking MCP Server**: Enhances problem-solving by breaking down complex issues into sequential steps, allowing the AI to provide more structured and thoughtful responses.

### **Implementation Status (Updated):**

1. ‚úÖ **Core MCP Framework**: Base types and hooks implemented
   - Complete implementation of Model, Context, Protocol abstractions
   - Synchronous and asynchronous message handling
   - React hooks for MCP integration

2. ‚úÖ **Business Intelligence Protocol**: Implemented and refactored into modular components for:
   - LinkedIn profile data gathering
   - Website research and data extraction
   - Company and contact information management
   - Confidence score tracking

3. ‚úÖ **Persona Management Protocol**: For adjusting AI tone based on user role
   - Dynamic persona determination based on user context
   - Support for strategist, technical, consultant, and general personas

   - Needs to be refactored into MCP architecture

5. ‚è≥ **Response Generation Protocol**: For personalized messaging
   - Basic implementation exists in responseGenerator service
   - Needs to be integrated with the Persona Management Protocol

### **Code Architecture Improvements:**

1. ‚úÖ **Modular Protocol Structure**: Refactored business intelligence and persona management protocols into:
   - Type definitions (`types.ts`)
   - Message creators (`messages.ts`)
   - Specialized handlers in separate files
   - Main protocol integration (`index.ts`)
   
2. ‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript interfaces with complete business data model and persona definitions

3. ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Improved error handling across async operations

4. ‚úÖ **Testing**: Added example components for protocol demonstration

### **Integration Priority List:**

   - Adjust response generators based on persona

2. ‚è≥ **Refactor Lead Qualification to MCP**:
   - Move existing lead stage logic to protocol pattern
   - Enhance with more sophisticated qualification rules

3. ‚è≥ **Create Response Generation Protocol**:
