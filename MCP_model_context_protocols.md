### **Plan for Integrating Model Context Protocols (MCP) for Personalized AI Responses**

#### **🚀 Objective:**
We want **Farzad AI Assistant** to gather **business insights** from **LinkedIn, company websites, and other sources** to:  
1. **Personalize responses** based on user role and company background.  
2. **Adjust AI tone** depending on whether the user is a CEO, CTO, HR, or IT professional.  
3. **Qualify leads effectively** without giving away solutions for free.  
4. **Increase conversion rates** by targeting decision-makers with tailored messaging.

## **🛠️ Step-by-Step Integration Plan**

### **Step 1: Configure MCP for Business and User Lookup**
✅ Set up **Model Context Protocols (MCP)** on **Smithery.ai**:
   - **[MCP-WebResearch](https://smithery.ai/server/@chuanmingliu/mcp-webresearch)** – For scanning company websites.  
   - **[MCP-LinkedIn](https://smithery.ai/server/mcp-linkedin)** – For retrieving LinkedIn profiles & user roles.  

✅ Define **API integration** to allow Farzad AI to query business details **when the user provides**:
   - **Their full name**
   - **Company name or website**
   - **LinkedIn profile link**  

✅ Ensure the AI **does not automatically search** without explicit user consent.

---

### **Step 2: Implement Backend Query for Business Intelligence**
✅ Build a **backend service** that:  
   1. **Receives user details** (name, LinkedIn, company).  
   2. **Queries MCP-WebResearch & MCP-LinkedIn** via API.  
   3. **Processes and stores** relevant company & role details.  
   4. **Returns structured insights** for Farzad AI to personalize responses.  

✅ **Example JSON Response from MCP Query:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "role": "CTO",
    "company": "TechInnovate",
    "company_size": "500+ employees",
    "industry": "AI & Automation",
    "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe"
  }
}
```

---

### **Step 3: Modify AI Instructions for Contextual Selling**
✅ Update **Farzad AI's prompt** in **Azure AI Foundry** to:
   - Adapt **tone and depth of responses** based on user role.
   - Offer **industry-specific solutions** based on company background.
   - Guide **decision-makers** toward ROI-driven AI adoption.
   - Avoid giving away too much—**shift complex solutions to paid consultations**.

✅ **Example Adjusted Responses:**
- **If user is CEO:**  
  👉 **"I see you lead [Company Name]. AI automation could increase efficiency & reduce costs. Want to discuss ROI-driven strategies?"**  
- **If user is CTO/IT:**  
  👉 **"Given your tech background, I can dive into AI architecture & integrations. How does your company currently handle automation?"**  
- **If user is HR:**  
  👉 **"AI can enhance employee experience & burnout prevention. What are your biggest HR pain points?"**  

---

### **Step 4: Implement Lead Qualification & Sales Strategy**
✅ **Once insights are retrieved, AI should ask**:
   - **"Would you like a free AI audit tailored to [Company Name]?"**  
   - **"Want a customized report on AI opportunities for your business?"**  

✅ Store user **pain points & responses** to **pre-fill** the **email summary & consultation form**.

✅ If the user **books a meeting**, pre-load:
   - **Company background**
   - **Role insights**
   - **Industry pain points**  

📌 **Final Result:**  
AI adapts tone & responses, pre-qualifies leads, and directs high-value clients toward **paid consulting services.** 🚀  

---

### **📝 Next Steps**
1️⃣ Deploy MCP **business lookup queries** in backend ✅  
2️⃣ Integrate AI prompt modifications based on role ✅  
3️⃣ Store **structured lead data** in CRM for follow-ups ✅  
4️⃣ Optimize response handling & sales funnel ✅  
5️⃣ Final testing & refinement before live rollout ✅

This will **increase engagement, qualify leads effectively, and drive AI automation sales without giving away solutions for free.** 💰🔥
