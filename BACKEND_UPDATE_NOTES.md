# Backend Update for Frontend Integration

## Acknowledgement of Backend Updates
Thank you for the recent updates to the backend service! I've reviewed the changes you made:

- ✅ Environment stabilization with proper Python dependencies
- ✅ CORS updates to allow `https://lovable.dev`
- ✅ New `/version` endpoint
- ✅ FastAPI documentation at `/docs`
- ✅ WebSocket handling improvements

## Frontend Implementation Status

I've implemented the frontend WebSocket client with the following features:

1. **WebSocket Connection Manager**:
   - Connection establishment with unique client IDs
   - Automatic reconnection with backoff
   - Ping/pong keep-alive mechanisms (20-25 second interval as recommended)
   - Proper error handling and connection status display

2. **Real-time Chat UI**:
   - Message sending and receiving 
   - Typing indicators
   - Connection status indicators
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

3. **Audio Streaming Support**:
   - Binary audio chunk processing
   - Audio playback with progress tracking
   - Play/pause/stop controls
   - Audio queue management

## Next Steps

Based on your responses to my questions, I've implemented the following:

1. **Ping/Pong Mechanism**: Set to ping every 20-25 seconds as recommended (well under the 45-second timeout)
2. **Text-Only Messages**: Frontend only sends text messages as the backend currently only supports text
3. **No Rate Limiting**: Implemented based on your confirmation that the backend has no rate limits
4. **Error Handling**: Properly handle and display errors that might come from the Gemini API
5. **Unique Client IDs**: Generate and use unique client IDs for each connection

Future enhancements I'll be working on:

1. Voice input support
2. Improved error recovery
3. Enhanced UI/UX for audio playback

Let me know if you need any further adjustments to the WebSocket client implementation.
