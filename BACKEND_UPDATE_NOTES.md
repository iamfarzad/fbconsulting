# Backend Update for Frontend Integration

## Backend Changes (v0.2.0)

- ‚ú® **Multimodal Support Added:** The backend now accepts messages with text and/or files (images, PDFs, etc.). See format below.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Internal Refinements:** Further improvements to WebSocket handling and logging.
- ‚úÖ **Environment Stable:** Backend runs reliably in IDX.

## Recent Frontend Implementation (v0.2.1)

- üé§ **Audio Transcription API Added:** Implemented the `/api/gemini/transcribe` endpoint for audio processing.
- üîÑ **WebSocket Refactoring:** Refactored WebSocket functionality into smaller, more maintainable hooks.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Bug Fixes:** Resolved several build errors related to WebSocket communication.
- üß© **Audio Services:** Implemented proper audio recording and processing infrastructure.

## Known Issues and Next Steps

- üö® **Gemini API Transcription Limitation:** Currently using a mock implementation for `/api/gemini/transcribe` as Gemini's API doesn't have a direct audio transcription capability like OpenAI's Whisper API. Need to discuss options:
  1. Implement server-side transcription using another service (Google Speech-to-Text API)
  2. Use a different model or wait for Gemini's API to support audio transcription
  3. Use browser's Speech API for transcription instead of server (current fallback approach)

- üêõ **Build Errors:** Working through remaining TypeScript errors related to the Copilot and UI components.

## WebSocket Connection Troubleshooting

We've identified and fixed several issues with WebSocket connections:
- Fixed connection URL construction to properly use environment configuration
- Improved reconnection logic and error handling
- Added proper status logging and user feedback

## Frontend Build Troubleshooting

The CSS build errors have been resolved with the recent fixes. WebSocket connections are now more reliable with proper error handling and reconnection logic.

## Using Multimodal Input

```json
{
  "type": "multimodal_message",
  "text": "Optional description...",
  "files": [
    {
      "mime_type": "image/jpeg", 
      "data": "BASE64_ENCODED_FILE_DATA", 
      "filename": "optional_image_name.jpg"
    }
  ],
  "role": "user", 
  "enableTTS": true 
}
```

Please continue to pull the latest changes and let us know if there are any issues with the implementation. Next priority is to implement a proper audio transcription solution that works with Gemini.
