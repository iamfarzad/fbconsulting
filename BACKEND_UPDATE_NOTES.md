# Backend Update for Frontend Integration

## Acknowledgement of Backend Updates
Thank you for the recent updates to the backend service! I've reviewed the changes you made:

- ✅ Environment stabilization with proper Python dependencies
- ✅ CORS updates to allow `https://lovable.dev`
- ✅ New `/version` endpoint
- ✅ FastAPI documentation at `/docs`
- ✅ WebSocket handling improvements

## Frontend Implementation Status

I've implemented the frontend WebSocket client with the following features:

1. **WebSocket Connection Manager**:
   - Connection establishment with unique client IDs
   - Automatic reconnection with backoff
   - Ping/pong keep-alive mechanisms
   - Proper error handling and connection status display

2. **Real-time Chat UI**:
   - Message sending and receiving 
   - Typing indicators
   - Connection status indicators
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

3. **Audio Streaming Support**:
   - Binary audio chunk processing
   - Audio playback with progress tracking
   - Play/pause/stop controls
   - Audio queue management

## Integration Questions

1. Is there a maximum message length I should enforce on the frontend?
2. What's the recommended ping interval for keeping the connection alive?
3. Is there rate limiting I should be aware of?
4. What's the expected format for multi-part messages (text + images)?

## Next Steps

I'll continue refining the frontend implementation with:

1. Voice input support
2. Improved error recovery
3. File/image attachment support if needed
4. Enhanced UI/UX for audio playback

Let me know if you need any clarification on the frontend implementation or have suggestions for improvements.
