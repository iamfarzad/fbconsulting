# Backend Update for Frontend Integration

## Acknowledgement of Backend Updates
Thank you for the recent updates to the backend service! I've reviewed the changes you made:

- ✅ Environment stabilization with proper Python dependencies
- ✅ CORS updates to allow `https://lovable.dev`
- ✅ New `/version` endpoint
- ✅ FastAPI documentation at `/docs`
- ✅ WebSocket handling improvements

## Frontend Implementation Status

I've implemented the frontend WebSocket client with the following features:

1. **WebSocket Connection Manager**:
   - Connection establishment with unique client IDs
   - Automatic reconnection with backoff
   - Ping/pong keep-alive mechanisms
   - Proper error handling and connection status display

2. **Real-time Chat UI**:
   - Message sending and receiving 
   - Typing indicators
   - Connection status indicators
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

3. **Audio Streaming Support**:
   - Binary audio chunk processing
   - Audio playback with progress tracking
   - Play/pause/stop controls
   - Audio queue management

## Integration Questions & Backend Answers

> 1. Is there a maximum message length I should enforce on the frontend?

**Backend Answer:** Currently, there's no *explicit* message length limit enforced by the FastAPI/WebSocket server itself or the Gemini client library in the current implementation. However, the underlying Gemini API (`gemini-2.0-flash`) likely has its own token limits per request (which often translates roughly to character limits, ~32k tokens input/output combined, but this is not precisely enforced on raw text length). It's generally good practice to avoid extremely long single messages. **Recommendation:** Consider a reasonable UI limit (e.g., 5000-10000 characters) on the frontend for usability, but the backend doesn't strictly require it right now.

> 2. What's the recommended ping interval for keeping the connection alive?

**Backend Answer:** The backend is currently configured with:
   - `WS_PING_INTERVAL = 30` seconds (how often the *client* should ideally ping the server, or how often the server waits before sending its own check).
   - `WS_PING_TIMEOUT = 10` seconds (how long the server might wait for a response to its own ping check).

   The server's receive loop (`websocket.receive_text()`) currently has a timeout slightly longer than `WS_PING_INTERVAL` and implements a server-side ping check if that timeout is hit. **Recommendation:** Your client-side ping interval should be less than the server's `WS_PING_INTERVAL * 1.5` timeout (currently 45s) to keep the connection alive during idle periods. Sending a client ping every **20-25 seconds** should be safe and reliable.

> 3. Is there rate limiting I should be aware of?

**Backend Answer:** No, the backend service itself **does not implement any rate limiting** currently. However, the underlying **Google Gemini API *does* have rate limits** (e.g., requests per minute). If the backend receives too many messages too quickly from multiple clients (or one very active client), it might hit the Google API limit, resulting in errors being sent back over the WebSocket (likely as `{"type": "error", "error": "...Resource has been exhausted..."}` or similar).

> 4. What's the expected format for multi-part messages (text + images)?

**Backend Answer:** The current backend code (`main.py` and `gemini_client.py`) **only supports text messages**. The `client.send_message` function currently only processes the `message["text"]` field.

   To support images, we would need to:
   a.  Define a new message format (e.g., using Base64 encoded images within the JSON message, or potentially a separate binary upload mechanism).
   b.  Update `gemini_client.py` to use the multimodal capabilities of the Gemini API (sending both text and image data in the request).
   c.  Update `main.py` to handle this new message format.

   **Currently, only send text messages.** Image support requires backend modifications.

## Next Steps

I'll continue refining the frontend implementation with:

1. Voice input support
2. Improved error recovery
3. File/image attachment support if needed
4. Enhanced UI/UX for audio playback

Let me know if you need any clarification on the frontend implementation or have suggestions for improvements.
