# Component Structure Optimization

## Overview
Refactor and optimize the React component structure to improve maintainability, reduce nesting, enhance performance, and follow best practices.

## Objectives
1. Reduce excessive component nesting
2. Improve code organization and maintainability
3. Enhance performance through optimized rendering
4. Standardize component patterns
5. Improve error handling throughout the component tree

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Component Audit
- [ ] Analyze current component structure
- [ ] Identify areas with excessive nesting
- [ ] Document component dependencies
- [ ] Measure component render performance
- [ ] Identify redundant or duplicate components

### Phase 2: Architecture Redesign
- [ ] Create improved component hierarchy
- [ ] Define clear component boundaries and responsibilities
- [ ] Design standardized component patterns
- [ ] Plan context API usage optimization
- [ ] Document new architecture

### Phase 3: Core Component Refactoring
- [ ] Refactor CopilotProvider for better separation of concerns
- [ ] Optimize ErrorBoundary implementation
- [ ] Enhance ChatButton and chat interface components
- [ ] Improve voice-related components
- [ ] Refactor context providers

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement React.memo for appropriate components
- [ ] Add useMemo and useCallback optimizations
- [ ] Implement code splitting for better loading
- [ ] Optimize context usage to prevent unnecessary renders
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Create unit tests for refactored components
- [ ] Update component documentation
- [ ] Add prop type validation
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Document performance improvements
