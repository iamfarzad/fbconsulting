## Branch Management

### Default Branch
- **main**: Last updated on Mar 23, 5.

### Active Branches
1. **fix-vercel-deployment**: Last updated on Mar 23, 2025.
2. **fix-api-key-issues**: Last updated on Mar 22, 2025.
3. **fix-deployment**: Last updated on Mar 22, 2025.

5. **fix-technical-level-types**: Last updated on Mar 22, 2025.

### Merge Status

To determine if these branches have been merged into main, you can use the following Git commands:

1. List Merged Branches:
   ```sh
   git branch --merged main
   ```

   This command lists all branches that have been merged into main. If a branch appears in this list, it has been successfully merged.

2. List Unmerged Branches:
   ```sh
   git branch --no-merged main
   ```

   This command lists branches that have not been merged into main.

### Recommendations
- **Delete Merged Branches**: After confirming that a branch has been merged into main, you can safely delete it to keep your repository clean:
  ```sh
  git branch -d branch_name
  ```
  Replace `branch_name` with the actual branch name.
- **Review Unmerged Branches**: For branches that haven’t been merged, assess their relevance. If they’re outdated or no longer needed, consider deleting them. If they contain necessary changes, plan to merge them appropriately.

Regularly managing your branches ensures a streamlined and organized repository.
