# Google Generative AI Integration with CopilotKit

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Google Generative AI (Gemini) integration with CopilotKit for the FB Consulting website. The integration provides a unified chat experience that leverages both CopilotKit and direct API calls to Google's Gemini models.

## Recent Updates (March 2025)

### Bug Fixes

1. **TypeScript Error Resolutions**:
   - Fixed type mismatches between CopilotKit and Google Generative AI interfaces
   - Resolved issues with Message and ChatMessage type conflicts
   - Added proper type assertions to ensure compatibility

2. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Added robust error handling throughout the chat components
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms when API keys or services are unavailable
   - Added graceful degradation for component failures
   - Fixed HelmetDispatcher errors in the SEO component
   - Added error boundaries to prevent app crashes

3. **Default Values and Fallbacks**:
   - Added default persona data when persona management fails
   - Implemented fallback responses when AI services are unavailable
   - Added proper null checking throughout the codebase

4. **React Warnings Resolution**:
   - Fixed AnimatePresence duplicate key warnings
   - Added unique keys to components in AnimatePresence
   - Improved component rendering to prevent unnecessary re-renders

5. **Application Architecture Improvements**:
   - Created a new SafeApp component with comprehensive error boundaries
   - Implemented lazy loading for all major components to improve performance
   - Added Suspense boundaries with fallback loading states
   - Created a more resilient application structure that prevents blank screens

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Unified Chat System**
   - `UnifiedChat.tsx`: A flexible chat component that works with both CopilotKit and direct Google AI calls
   - `UnifiedFullScreenChat.tsx`: A full-screen version of the chat component
   - `useUnifiedChat.ts`: A custom hook that manages chat state and interactions

2. **Google Generative AI Service**
   - `googleGenerativeAIService.ts`: Service for interacting with Google's Gemini models
   - `googleGenerativeAIAdapter.ts`: Adapter for connecting Google Generative AI to CopilotKit

3. **Lead Capture & Email**
   - `leadCaptureService.ts`: Service for capturing lead information from chat interactions
   - `emailService.ts`: Service for sending email summaries of conversations

4. **Configuration & Context**
   - `GeminiAPIProvider`: Context provider for Google Generative AI API key
   - `GoogleGenerativeAIConfig.tsx`: Component for configuring Google Generative AI settings

### Data Flow

1. User sends a message through the chat interface
2. The message is processed by either:
   - CopilotKit's chat system (if `useCopilotKit` is true)
   - Direct API call to Google Generative AI (if `useCopilotKit` is false)
3. The response is displayed in the chat interface
4. Lead information is extracted from the conversation
5. Email summaries are sent when conversations end

## Key Features

- **Unified Chat Experience**: Consistent UI regardless of the underlying AI service
- **Full-Screen Mode**: Enhanced chat experience with expanded view
- **Lead Capture**: Automatic extraction of lead information from conversations
- **Email Summaries**: Ability to send conversation summaries via email
- **Persona Management**: Dynamic AI personas that adapt based on context

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

- `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google Generative AI API key
- `VITE_COPILOT_RUNTIME_URL`: CopilotKit runtime URL
- `VITE_EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY`: API key for the email service
- `VITE_LEAD_CAPTURE_ENDPOINT`: Endpoint for lead capture service

## Testing

The implementation can be tested using the following routes:

- `/test-unified-chat`: Test the unified chat components
- `/test-google-ai`: Test the direct Google AI integration

## Future Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize message rendering for large conversations
2. **Analytics Integration**: Add analytics to track chat usage and performance
3. **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure the chat interface is fully accessible
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Further optimize the chat experience for mobile devices
5. **Type Safety Enhancements**: Further improve TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
6. **Testing Suite**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
7. **Documentation**: Create detailed API documentation for all components
