# Test Setup - Sequential Approach

## 1. Core Test Environment
- Basic test runner setup (Vitest)
- Essential DOM environment (jsdom)
- Minimal mocks required

## 2. Utility Layer
- Test utilities
- Common mocks
- Helper functions

## 3. Component Testing Infrastructure
- React testing setup
- Component render utilities
- Common component test patterns

## 4. Integration Points
- API mocking
- External service interfaces
- Event handling

## 5. CI Environment
- GitHub Actions configuration
- Environment-specific settings
- Build and test pipeline

Let's implement these layers one at a time, verifying each step works before moving to the next.
